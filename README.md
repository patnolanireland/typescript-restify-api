# TypeScript Restify API Server

### Prerequisites

1. [NodeJS >= 6.3.0](https://nodejs.org/)

## Quickstart

```

npm install -g pm2@latest bunyan

npm install

npm run watch

```

## Overview

This is a base scaffolding for a Restify API Server using TypeScript. [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is used for
process management leveraging `pm2-dev` with `npm scripts` to manage the development workflow. Debugging can be
performed by [Chrome Dev Tools](https://medium.com/@paul_irish/debugging-node-js-nightlies-with-chrome-devtools-7c4a1b95ae27#.c78xd8wsz).

This tech is currently embryonic and in order to get source maps to work running with the `--user-data-dir` flag is
necessary e.g.

```
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --no-first-run --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-dev-profile
```

## Project Scaffolding

This project has been generated by Yeoman with the [`node-typescript`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node) generator. Essentially the TypeScript source is contained in the src directory and transpiled to lib.

## Testing

Mocha, Chai and Supertest are currently used for testing

```
npm run test
```
